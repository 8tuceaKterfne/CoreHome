One of the remarkable stories in the book is how Siti Khadijah proposed marriage to Prophet Muhammad. She was impressed by his honesty, integrity, and character when he worked for her as a merchant. She sent her friend Nafisah to ask him if he was interested in marrying her. He agreed and consulted his uncle Abu Talib, who arranged the marriage contract. They got married when he was 25 and she was 40 years old.
 
Another story is how Siti Khadijah comforted and reassured Prophet Muhammad when he received the first revelation from Allah. He was terrified and shaken by the experience of meeting the angel Jibril in the cave of Hira. He ran back to his home and asked Siti Khadijah to cover him with a blanket. She listened to his account and told him that Allah would never forsake him. She took him to her cousin Waraqah bin Nawfal, who confirmed that he was a prophet of Allah.
 
A third story is how Siti Khadijah sacrificed her wealth and status for the sake of Islam. She spent her fortune to support the Prophet and his followers who faced persecution and boycott from the Quraysh. She endured hunger, thirst, and hardship along with them in the valley of Abu Talib for three years. She never complained or wavered in her faith. She died shortly after the end of the boycott, leaving the Prophet heartbroken and grieving.
